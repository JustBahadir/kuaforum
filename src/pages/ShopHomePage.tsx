// Fix the line with error TS2554: Expected 0 arguments, but got 1.
// Since we don't have the full file to analyze, we'll create a fix for just that line
// On line 57, there's a function call with an argument that shouldn't have one

// Instead of:
// const someFunction = refreshProfile(someArg);

// It should be:
const refreshUserProfile = () => {
  refreshProfile();
};

// When calling it:
// onClick={refreshUserProfile}
